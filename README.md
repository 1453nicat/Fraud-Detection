# Fraud-Detection

Fraud detection refers to the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities, typically in financial transactions, by analyzing patterns and behaviors that deviate from normal or expected actions. It aims to protect individuals, businesses, and organizations from financial loss, identity theft, and other types of fraudulent behavior. Fraud detection is commonly applied in areas such as banking, e-commerce, insurance, and credit card transactions.

This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The dataset used for this project contains real-world credit card transactions, where the goal is to classify each transaction as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. We apply several machine learning algorithms and techniques to create an effective fraud detection model. This model can be used by financial institutions to automatically identify suspicious transactions, reducing potential losses from fraudulent activity.

# Libraries
numpy and pandas: for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization
sklearn: for machine learning
